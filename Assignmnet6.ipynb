Those are opposite behaviors, but the surface similarities may lead one to believe that OOP better models human thought. See also: ObjectVsModel, OopNotForDomainModeling.\n",

    "Looking at \"comfort\" level is a terrible way to measure whether something is related to \"human thought processes\" because it depends heavily upon other factors, such as familiarity. What the body of hard psychological evidence tells us is that all people (barring genetic defect, brain damage, or psychoactive drugs) perform the same cognitive functions, learn and think and recognize and pattern match by the same mechanisms. Humans are not that different"
